ISAD Project data modelling
In this sql query code and visual studio code they both are connected to each other.
In sql workbench i have established a table and imported the data as per the dle in tabled and then i have connected the workbench through VS with the sample code provided by Marco in dle. The VS code makes a desktop interface by extracting data from those tables.It works on a combo query box by selcting each table from the tab.
I have uploaded Vs in zip and unzip folder both the way!
Thank you
